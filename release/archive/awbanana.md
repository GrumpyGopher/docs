## Please Read Carefully

{: .new }
> The update requires you to already have **2410.1 BANANA** or **2410.2 BIG BANANA** already setup and installed
> on your device. Using modified MustardOS installations or previous versions may have strange or breaking outcomes.

{: .important }
> * To get the most benefit out of this release you will **need to reflash!**
> * We now set threaded video to off and set the display timing to `60.00hz` for all devices
> * If you are running into any weird stuttering ensure you reset (_or remove_) your current RetroArch configuration set
> * You can install the update straight over the top of **any existing Banana**, or **Big Banana**, release including
    those who have previously installed updates
> * 1080p resolution via HDMI has been temporarily disabled due to video memory issues with muX. This is not a breaking
    issue and will be fixed for Pixie.
